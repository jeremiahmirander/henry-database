I ran the webite on a local server using usb webserver and imported the database tables on phpAdmin. The entire thing can be found in the server folder and the php files are in the root folder. The header for the php files are from bootstrap.
I pledge that the work submitted is entirely mine with exception of source code required to make a functioning website.
